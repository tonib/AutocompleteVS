Show somewhere in UI the progress of current suggestion
	See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/extending-the-status-bar?view=vs-2022

Set a max timeout for showing a suggestion: If it's reached, stop current generation and show the suggestion
	Stop in a safe place: Don't stop if a block / line is open

Error: Sometimes suggestions are ALWAYS cancelled. 
	Show in log the cancellation reason (cursor moved, buffer changed)
	I think it is buffer changed event. If is this, confirm buffer really changed

CustomServer: Fix version references to work in Vs 2019
	Remove asp.net / signal, will not work in VS 2019: Use a plain socket server instead

ERROR: Sometimes, when you type space or point, following current suggestions, a new suggestion is restarted (prefix srinked)
	It seems internally VS removes / re-adds typed characters. Handle this case

allow inline generations if current line ends only with: ", ', ), ;
	rationale: autoclosed characters by VS
Option to stop generating prompt after line break (performance, for in middle of line filling) [DONE]
	For single line generations, check if if has repeated text at the line end. In this case, remove it
	Same for multi line generations. Check if there are repeated lines
Re-suggest in the same place: Try an alternative suggestion with a different topk, topp, temperature
openai api: 
	apply all configuration
	use streaming and stop early (use SuggestionStringBuilder)
	test single line generation
multiline suggestions: tab characters are replaced by 4 spaces. Read the number of spaces to place from vs settings
Check read only editors (ex git history): Do not handle autocompletion here
Check diff editor (ex git current changes): autocompletion should be handled here
Show something on the UI (adorment or something else), if autocompletions generation is running
ERROR: If you type "public bool IsOut(Point p)" and you ask a suggestion, if between the codelens info si added, the suggestion
	appears in the codelens suggestion, and not in the real code line
Refactoring: Move all MEF Exports to ViewAutocompleteHandler ???
Check other models
Suppor for Ctrl + < ??? (undo adding word)
Codeqwen: Support for <|cursor|> Check WTF is this (cursor position???)
Check larger models (performance)
If when keep typing, the text keeps the suggestion, suggestion should not be removed
	Partially fixed, sometimes prefix is shinked
Add a timeout after stop typing before running suggestion? (performance)
ERROR: Suggestions indentation is plain wrong
Option to suggest in the middle of a line

Try to put again nuget ollamasharp reference:
