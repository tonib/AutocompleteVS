Replace all Debug.WriteLine for calls to the VS output pane
Add categories for settings
Option to log to output pane the generation stats (with a log level)
Install current version and use it (own dog food eating)
Make a end trim of suggestion (unwanted line breaks)
Re-suggest in the same place: Try an alternative suggestion with a different topk, topp, temperature
configuration for openai api
multiline suggestions: tab characters are replaced by 4 spaces. Read the number of spaces to place from vs settings
Check read only editors (ex git history): Do not handle autocompletion here
Check diff editor (ex git current changes): autocompletion should be handled here
Show something on the UI (adorment or something else), if autocompletions generation is running
ERROR: If you type "public bool IsOut(Point p)" and you ask a suggestion, if between the codelens info si added, the suggestion
	appears in the codelens suggestion, and not in the real code line
Performance: If we are generatign a suggestions in non empty line, only the first line will be rendered. It's not needed to
	generate a full multiline suggestion. So, two options: 1) Stop suggestion generation when a \n is reached. 2) Cache
	generation in case current suggestion is confirmed
Refactoring: Move all MEF Exports to ViewAutocompleteHandler ???
Check other models
Suppor for Ctrl + < ??? (undo adding word)
Codeqwen: Support for <|cursor|> Check WTF is this (cursor position???)
Check larger models (performance)
If when keep typing, the text keeps the suggestion, suggestion should not be removed
Do not suggest after current code block. ex: if(){ <cursor> }. It seems closes the existing bracket and starts a new one
	Same, i guess, for parenthesis in interline suggestions. It's VERY annoying
Related to previous: Support for non infill models. Option to do not infill
Validate settings in the options page
Add a timeout after stop typing before running suggestion? (performance)
ERROR: Suggestions indentation is plain wrong
Option to suggest in the middle of a line

Try to put again nuget ollamasharp reference:
	IS NOT WORKING
