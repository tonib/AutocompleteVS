The message "[Ctrl + ...]" should be configurable (show / not show) or make it look better

Error: Sometimes suggestions are ALWAYS cancelled. 
	Show in log the cancellation reason (cursor moved, buffer changed)
	I think it is buffer changed event. If is this, confirm buffer really changed

CustomServer: Fix version references to work in Vs 2019
	Remove asp.net / signal, will not work in VS 2019: Use a plain socket server instead

Inline suggestions: Try again to use inline adorments

Use BatchedExecutor

ERROR: Sometimes, when you type space or point, following current suggestions, a new suggestion is restarted (prefix srinked)
	It seems internally VS removes / re-adds typed characters. Handle this case

Option to stop generating prompt after line break (performance, for in middle of line filling) [DONE]
	For single line generations, check if if has repeated text at the line end. In this case, remove it
	Same for multi line generations. Check if there are repeated lines
Re-suggest in the same place: Try an alternative suggestion with a different topk, topp, temperature
openai api: 
	apply all configuration
	use streaming and stop early (use SuggestionStringBuilder)
	test single line generation
multiline suggestions: tab characters are replaced by 4 spaces. Read the number of spaces to place from vs settings
Check diff editor (ex git current changes): autocompletion should be handled here
ERROR: If you type "public bool IsOut(Point p)" and you ask a suggestion, if between the codelens info si added, the suggestion
	appears in the codelens suggestion, and not in the real code line
Refactoring: Move all MEF Exports to ViewAutocompleteHandler ???
Check other models
Codeqwen: Support for <|cursor|> Check WTF is this (cursor position???)
Check larger models (performance)
If when keep typing, the text keeps the suggestion, suggestion should not be removed
	Partially fixed, sometimes prefix is shinked
Add a timeout after stop typing before running suggestion? (performance)

Post-processing:
	Repeated code at line end on inline suggestions, avoid it
	Do not allow generation to close parenthesis non open parentheses (inline generations)

Try to put again nuget ollamasharp reference:
	IS NOT WORKING
