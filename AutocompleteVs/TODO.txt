Config:
	When using extension for first time, create a default configuration
	Create a command for each autocompletion configuration
	Configure a autocompletion configuration to use for automatic autocompletions
	Export / import configuration

ERROR: Suggestion text has no right alignment (by pixels)

ERROR: There are issues when autocompletion is shown and you delete the current code line.
	A inline suggestion is shown

Check how to disable VS 2002 inline suggestions, or check how to know if some of these VS 
	suggestions is visible (in this case, dont show ours)

ERROR:
	If a multiline suggestion is shown, screen makes scroll to see the suggestion end.
	If screen resolution is small, you even dont see the caret position

The message "[Ctrl + ...]" should be configurable (show / not show) or make it look better

Error: Sometimes suggestions are ALWAYS cancelled. 
	Show in log the cancellation reason (cursor moved, buffer changed)
	I think it is buffer changed event. If is this, confirm buffer really changed

CustomServer: Fix version references to work in Vs 2019
	Remove asp.net / signal, will not work in VS 2019: Use a plain socket server instead

	It seems is fixed: If so, remove _References directory

Inline suggestions: Try again to use inline adorments

Use BatchedExecutor

Option to stop generating prompt after line break (performance, for in middle of line filling) [DONE]
	For single line generations, check if if has repeated text at the line end. In this case, remove it
	Same for multi line generations. Check if there are repeated lines
Re-suggest in the same place: Try an alternative suggestion with a different topk, topp, temperature
openai api: 
	apply all configuration
	use streaming and stop early (use SuggestionStringBuilder)
	test single line generation
multiline suggestions: tab characters are replaced by 4 spaces. Read the number of spaces to place from vs settings
Check diff editor (ex git current changes): autocompletion should be handled here
ERROR: If you type "public bool IsOut(Point p)" and you ask a suggestion, if between the codelens info si added, the suggestion
	appears in the codelens suggestion, and not in the real code line
Refactoring: Move all MEF Exports to ViewAutocompleteHandler ???
Check other models
Codeqwen: Support for <|cursor|> Check WTF is this (cursor position???)
Check larger models (performance)
If when keep typing, the text keeps the suggestion, suggestion should not be removed
	Partially fixed, sometimes prefix is shinked
Add a timeout after stop typing before running suggestion? (performance)

Post-processing:
	Repeated code at line end on inline suggestions, avoid it

Try to put again nuget ollamasharp reference:
	IS NOT WORKING

In VS 2022, current suggestions and VS suggestions are rendered at same time, at same place.
Check if there is a way to avoid it
